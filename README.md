#chasm: The Coordinated Hard Sphere Mixture Model for silicate melt thermodynamics
CHaSM is a simplified model for the high pressure-temperature thermodynamics (and structure) of silicate and oxide melts (as published in Wolf et al. 2015).
This Python package implements the CHaSM model in an open-source format.
