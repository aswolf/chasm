This directory is different from all others!
Here the subdirs are all labeled by their date yyyy-mm-dd reflecting the first day in which an experiment was begun.
This directory is reserved for numerical experiments like running dft code, running gcm simulations, conducting synchrotron visits, etc.

The README.md file in this directory gives a short summary (few lines) about what is in each exp directory.
This file is like a table of contents for the experiments that were performed.
The gory details are in the README.md file within the relevant exp directory.
Sometimes multiple experiments were started on the same day.
They are stored in the same directory, and then logically organized beneath it.
