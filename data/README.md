This directory holds the data for the project, along with the processing scripts.
Some of the data may be static (i.e. downloaded from an internet database).
Some may be processed from the exp directory.
All of the data is stored in the storage directory, regardless of type.
Processing scripts are kept in parallel (with the same naming convention) in the process directory.
Processed data is stored just like static data, but it points back to the directory where the processing scripts are kept.
